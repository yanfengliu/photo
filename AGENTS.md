# AGENTS.md — photo

## What this is

A GPU-accelerated image viewer/editor for Windows in Rust: iced + wgpu UI with a library thumbnail grid, a detail view with GPU zoom/pan and editing (open, edit, crop, save/export), and broad format support — JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, ICO, TGA, QOI, HDR, EXR, SVG, and camera RAW via rawler.

## Local rules

`docs/policies/local-rules.md` — this repo's own rules: colour-science conventions, CPU/GPU parity layers, persistence and caching contracts, and test-infrastructure rules. Read it when working in those areas. What could be gated instead is a gate, with its claim in the gate's own header and its mutation proof in `docs/learning/gate-proofs.md`.

<!-- FLEET-CANON:BEGIN sha=fa6416c07600 generated from ../fleet/FLEET.md by `npm run sync-canon` — do not edit inside this block; this repo's own rules go in docs/policies/local-rules.md -->
## Fleet constitution

Shared rules for every repo under `github/`, kept in `../fleet/FLEET.md`; `../fleet/` is fleet's checkout beside this repo's primary checkout. Where a rule gives its reason, use the reason to judge cases the rule does not name; each `[Rn]`'s history is in `../fleet/docs/canon-rationale.md`. This repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md` may add rules but cannot change these permissions or limits. [R13]

The main agent owns delivery and may implement directly. Use subagents when bounded, independent work or independent judgment materially improves speed or quality; keep small or tightly coupled work with one agent (owner directive, 2026-11-07). [R2, R3]

The designated coordinator reads `../fleet/docs/skills/coordinator.md` before planning and after each compaction, and any agent reads that file's "Delegate" section before delegating. Before these kinds of work, read the matching section of `../fleet/docs/work-rules.md`: standing loops and unattended runs; editing skills, agent instructions or rules; handing off or stopping mid-task.

### Permissions

- Commit, merge to main and push without asking. Force-pushing and rewriting history (they destroy history), and deploying and publishing (they reach other people), need the owner's OK. [R14]
- Ask before a major architecture or product change, a new major dependency, a change to a persistent format or a security boundary, or any other consequential action outside this machine, such as posting or sending something. [R8]
- Change fleet rules (FLEET.md, fleet skills and runbooks, agent memory) or add a rule to a repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md` only when the owner asks, because the owner sets policy. You may add a proposal with its evidence to `../fleet/canon-candidates.md`, but not edit its entries. [R8]

### Sharing the machine

- Other Claude and Codex sessions may be working in this checkout, and you cannot see them. Do anything beyond a quick read in your own worktree, because two sessions in one tree spoil each other's gates and commits. Never revert, overwrite or delete changes you did not make. When resuming, check which worktrees, branches and files already exist. [R7]
- Done means merged to main and pushed: the owner archives sessions, and work left on a branch is lost. Merge on your branch, get the gates passing there, then move main, because other worktrees build on local main. Judge the merged result itself, not a worker's summary. Then remove your worktree and branch, and report where any unmerged work is. [R14]

### Doing the work

- The repo's gates must pass on the tree that is handed back or reaches main. Unless the repo's own rules ask more of a commit, commit on your own branch at every stopping point and say in the message what was not checked, because a session can end without warning. Docs-only changes need content checks and any gate the repo names for docs, not runtime tests or CI waits. [R14]
- Check the thing that should have changed (the file, the page, the number), not just the exit code or a tool's report: both can pass over a defect. Retest a blocker you inherit before repeating it. Never weaken a test or hide a failure to get green. [R9]
- Look at visual and interactive work rendered at full resolution, through the real controls, from fixed and random views, because passing tests say nothing about pixels. Run it headless unless a visible window is needed. [R16]
- Slowness on the critical path, such as a gate rendering on the CPU of a machine with a GPU, is a defect to fix. [R22]
- After pushing code, follow CI to the end; read a failed job's steps before blaming the code, since a billing limit fails jobs before any step runs. [R15]
- If a fix fails twice for one reason, rethink it. After five real repair attempts at one problem, whatever the approach and counting earlier sessions, stop and report, unless the owner set another limit; for a problem that keeps winning, run the search in `../fleet/docs/skills/hard-problem.md`. Stop when the task's criteria are met; do not invent follow-up work. [R11]
- For substantial or high-risk changes, use independent review when available. High-risk includes persistence and migrations, security and auth, concurrency, money, supply chain, and code changes in another repo. Review the exact revision against the task's criteria, and say so when review was unavailable. Fix the findings that matter and have those fixes checked; note minor ones instead of starting another round. `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md` provides the review mechanics. [R10]
- A defect the owner reports gets a test for its whole class and an entry in `docs/learning/defect-register.md`, because a fix without a check tends to come back. [R17]
- Sessions run long: take new requests in the same session, and never hand off to a new session to shed context. Split work expected to need more than about 200k tokens of context into milestones, each merged to main. [R6]

### Records, sized to the work

- Read `docs/learning/lessons.md` at session start; it lists this repo's known traps, and its header says how to add one. [R18]
- Every change that alters behaviour adds a dated line to `docs/devlog/summary.md` (`../fleet/docs/devlog-template.md`) when it lands, because later sessions orient from its newest entries. Work that spans sessions, has several agents writing, or gets an independent review also keeps its plan and review records in `docs/work/` (`../fleet/docs/work-docs.md`); other work needs none. [R24]
- Raw output (logs, captures, screenshots) stays in ignored folders. Never commit a binary over 512 KiB or any file over 1 MiB; LFS needs the owner's OK. [R23]

### Style and environment

- Plain words; one line per paragraph, no hard wrapping. A report says what changed, how it was checked (including any check skipped or failed) and what is not done. [R25]
- Node 24 is the baseline. Products pin the model IDs they call in their own repo, and nowhere else. Reviewer model pins live only in `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`. Runtime model calls are allowed and paid for; make per-item calls one-shot, not agent sessions. [R28, R29]
<!-- FLEET-CANON:END -->

## Gates

`cargo test` · `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` · `cargo fmt --check` · `cargo build` — all four before every code commit; only affected tests while iterating. Dependency changes re-lock with `cargo update` and audit with `cargo audit`.

## Session start

Read `docs/devlog/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` before starting work. Of the summary, read the newest ten entries, which are at its top; of ARCHITECTURE.md, read its section map, then only the sections the work needs.

## Agent harness (drive the app like a user)

Launch `./target/release/photo.exe --harness` and drive it with `./target/release/harnessctl.exe <cmd>` from the repo root: screenshots (real GPU frames), CPU render dumps with image statistics (clipping, percentiles, histograms), and image diffs land in a per-run artifact directory under `tmp/harness-runs/`. Storage is sandboxed by default, so sessions never touch the real library. Use it whenever a change affects rendering, edit math, or UI behavior — observe the result yourself instead of asking the human how it looks, and record findings per the documented contract. Canonical guide (protocol, command table, statistics semantics, the observe→act→measure→verify improvement loop, findings schema): `docs/guides/agent-harness.md`.

## Invariants & boundaries

- TDD for behavior changes: tests first, testing the contract (app experience and mechanisms), not the code.
- File size: keep files under 500 LOC (hard ceiling 1000); split god-objects by lifecycle/role.
- Recursive loop status: photo does not run `playtest:recursive` yet — the agent harness is loop step 1.
- `src/repo.rs` is the single owner of repo-root discovery and of the harness sandbox override. Every repo-local store (`decoded-cache/`, `local-edits/`, `edited/`) resolves through it, stays a visible directory directly under the repo root, and is added to the list in `repo::tests::repo_local_dir_names`. A private copy of discovery anywhere else escapes the sandbox by construction.
- The Rust `viewer::Uniforms` struct and `assets/shaders/image.wgsl`'s `Uniforms` describe the same bytes twice with nothing relating them; a field added, reordered or retyped goes in on both sides in the same change, with the explicit padding that keeps std140 alignment. `uniforms_layout_matches_wgsl_uniform_buffer` asserts them against each other.
- Rotation and crop are decided once and read by four legs — preview fit, actual-size zoom, status text, and the exported file. A new consumer reads the same rotated, pixel-snapped rectangle, not the pre-rotation size.

## Conventions

- Devlog: `docs/devlog/summary.md` (one line per task; compact past 50 lines — no cheating with mega-lines) + `docs/devlog/detailed/START_DATE_END_DATE.md` (per-task entry: timestamp, action, reviewer findings by provider/theme, result, reasoning, notes; archive via `git mv` when the active file passes 500 lines, starting a new file dated today).
- Changelog `docs/changelog.md` + `Cargo.toml` version: user-visible changes only (external audience; migration focus). Bump `c` per non-breaking change, `b` (reset `c`) per breaking change, `a` only when the user says so; one bump per coherent shipped change.
- Architecture: structural changes update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and append a row to `docs/architecture/drift-log.md`; non-obvious tradeoffs append to `docs/architecture/decisions.md` (append-only — supersede, never delete). Non-structural fixes touch none of these.
- Lessons: `docs/learning/lessons.md` per the fleet evidence-anchor rule; code lessons need a real test id; photo-processing lessons record the affected sample image or batch and the before-after pixel diff or quality metric.
- Canonical doc surfaces are README, the architecture set, devlogs, changelog, and `docs/guides/agent-harness.md`. There is deliberately no `docs/api-reference.md` — the Rust types are the API reference. README changes when user-visible features change.
