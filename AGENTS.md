## What this is

A GPU-accelerated image viewer/editor for Windows in Rust: iced + wgpu UI with a library thumbnail grid, a detail view with GPU zoom/pan and editing (open, edit, crop, save/export), and broad format support — JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, ICO, TGA, QOI, HDR, EXR, SVG, and camera RAW via rawler.

## Local rules

`docs/policies/local-rules.md` — this repo's own rules: colour-science conventions, CPU/GPU parity layers, persistence and caching contracts, and test-infrastructure rules. Read it when working in those areas. What could be gated instead is a gate, with its claim in the gate's own header and its mutation proof in `docs/learning/gate-proofs.md`.

## Fleet constitution

Reasons and evidence per `[Rn]`: `../fleet/docs/canon-rationale.md`. `../fleet/` is fleet's checkout beside the repo's primary checkout, also from a worktree. The designated coordinator reads `../fleet/docs/skills/coordinator.md` before planning and after each compaction, and any agent reads that file's "Delegate" section before delegating. Before these kinds of work, read the matching section of `../fleet/docs/work-rules.md`: visual and interactive work; games, simulations and research; measuring, debugging and slow steps; writing error messages; toolchains, dependencies and model calls; standing loops and unattended runs; pushing executable changes; a user-reported defect; editing skills, agent instructions or rules; run output and files over 256 KiB; handing off or stopping mid-task.

### Fleet Orchestration Policy

Deliver the requested outcome with verified correctness, coherent architecture and minimal necessary complexity. Optimize useful progress, not agent count, code volume or maximum reasoning. Adapt rigor to risk. This policy grants no new permissions or capabilities. [R1]

**Roles.** Only an explicitly designated agent coordinates; each scope has one accountable integration owner. [R2]

Workers own bounded outcomes and local implementation decisions. [R3]

Inspect instructions, code, docs, tree state and active tasks; set outcome, non-goals, acceptance criteria, dependencies and verification; settle ambiguity with evidence and reversible defaults. [R4]

**Session size** (owner directives, 2026-09-23 and 2026-10-22). Sessions run long: take new requests as separate assignments in the same session, and never hand off to a successor session to shed context; auto-compaction carries the session. Split tasks expected to exceed about 200k context tokens into milestones within that budget, each committed and merged to main once green. Milestones are task boundaries; a compaction never justifies wrapping up or handing off. [R6]

**Coordinate safely.** Beyond a trivial read, each session or agent defaults to its own worktree; serialize overlapping writes only when none is available, and say why. Finish each bounded increment in its session: merge to main, push, then `git worktree remove`, remove completed task-owned branches and unneeded temporary files, and explicitly transfer the ownership and location of still-needed resources. Report any merged worktree left and its location as a defect. Never overwrite or discard another participant's work. On resumption, first inspect surviving worktrees, artifacts and task status, assuming nothing survived until checked; recover what exists and preserve unfinished work. [R7]

Workers act autonomously in scope; escalate cross-task interfaces, persistent formats, security boundaries, major dependencies and scope changes to the coordinator for resolution within the approved mandate. Unapproved major architecture or product changes and consequential external actions need human authorization. Fleet rules (FLEET.md, the fleet's skills and runbooks, canon candidates, and agent memory) change only when the owner asks (owner directive, 2026-10-28). Agents propose changes instead of making them. The one exception: they may add a proposal to `../fleet/canon-candidates.md`, with the lesson, its evidence and the rule it would change (owner directive, 2026-10-29). They never change, promote or delete an entry: the owner decides each one, and the session the owner asks makes the change. Never reset consumed allowances. [R8]

**Implement and verify.** Inspect, implement a coherent increment, check, diagnose, fix, recheck. Preserve architecture; no unrelated rewrites, speculative abstractions or unnecessary dependencies. Implement when requested. Use task-appropriate evidence and baselines; prototype uncertain ideas before generalizing. Never weaken tests or conceal failures to claim success. Docs-only work uses content and version checks; skip runtime tests and CI waits. [R9]

During authorized work and within scope and budget, proactively improve products and the task's orchestration, learn from recorded outcomes and propose improvements to fleet rules. Read `../fleet/docs/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md` when proposing a fleet-rule change or turning a mistake into a gate (owner directive, 2026-10-29). [R33]

Obtain independent, preferably read-only review for substantial or high-risk changes when available. Review the exact revision against acceptance criteria. Report unavailable review; fix justified findings, rerun affected checks, and obtain focused re-review when fixes invalidate earlier review. [R10]

**Integrate, report, and stop.** Reassess after two failures for one reason. Unless another budget is set or the user authorizes more, cap automatic repair at five substantive attempts, then report; explicit overrides hold for their stated scope without asking again. Keep updates brief and decision-relevant. Stop when acceptance criteria and material findings are resolved; invent no follow-up work. [R11]

**Final acceptance gate.** The integration owner integrates in dependency order and on the final integrated revision's actual changes and evidence, not worker summaries, checks every acceptance criterion, runs relevant automated checks and exercises affected end-to-end behavior and cross-task interactions. Substantial or high-risk work gets independent read-only review of the integrated changes, integration fixes included. Confirm the merge to main; report that revision, review status and every failed, skipped or unavailable check and unmet criterion. Nothing is fully verified with an open material finding or required check. [R12]

### Fleet conventions

- Repository rules add local constraints consistent with this policy; they cannot override its permissions, adaptive workflow or stopping limits. [R13]
- Gates pass before any commit touching code, a merge included: merge on a detached HEAD or its own branch and move main to it once its gate passes. The user's standing grant covers committing, merging to main and pushing in their repos; force-pushing, rewriting history, deploying and publishing still need authorization. Work is done only once merged to main, regardless of green branch or worktree gates; report unmerged work's location. [R14]
- For substantial or high-risk changes, use independent review when available. High-risk includes persistence and migrations, security and auth, concurrency, money, supply chain, and executable changes in sibling repos; `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md` provides the review mechanics. [R10]
- Reviewer model pins live only in `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`; every model a product calls is pinned in its calling repo. No model IDs are hardcoded elsewhere. [R29]
- Read `docs/learning/lessons.md` at session start. Record the session's lessons there; each names its retiring gate and is deleted in the commit landing it. A gate counts only after going red with the defect reintroduced, following `../fleet/docs/lessons-template.md`. [R18]
- Gates prove nothing beyond their bounds: name the bound in the header and pin every reproducing input. Distinguish passed from did-not-run; a check built from its checked symbol proves only self-agreement. [R19]
- Verify outcomes beyond exit status, red or green, and return values: read the artifact that should have changed. Retest inherited blockers before repeating them. [R20]
- Keep plans and every authored review round in permanent `docs/work/<id>_<theme>/` folders (`../fleet/docs/work-docs.md`). Record history, not status: a dated devlog line per behaviour-changing session in `docs/devlog/summary.md` (`../fleet/docs/devlog-template.md`). [R24]
- Use common words with the same meaning in chat, docs, commits, PRs, comments and errors. One idea per sentence unless a rule needs more. Cut length, not facts: keep exact terms, numbers and evidence. Quotes and pastes are exempt; do not copy this canon's style. One line per paragraph, no hard wrapping. [R25]
- When blocked, immediately hand over the redacted artifact with the named blocker, before analysis; continue safe independent work. [R27]
- The owner's directions that outlive a task land that session in `../fleet/FLEET.md` if fleet-wide, otherwise the repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md`; report where. [R31]
- When a hard problem blocks progress, run the search in `../fleet/docs/skills/hard-problem.md`. [R32]
<!-- FLEET-CANON:END -->

## Gates

`cargo test` · `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` · `cargo fmt --check` · `cargo build` — all four before every code commit; only affected tests while iterating. Dependency changes re-lock with `cargo update` and audit with `cargo audit`.

## Session start

Read `docs/devlog/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` before starting work.

## Agent harness (drive the app like a user)

Launch `./target/release/photo.exe --harness` and drive it with `./target/release/harnessctl.exe <cmd>` from the repo root: screenshots (real GPU frames), CPU render dumps with image statistics (clipping, percentiles, histograms), and image diffs land in a per-run artifact directory under `tmp/harness-runs/`. Storage is sandboxed by default, so sessions never touch the real library. Use it whenever a change affects rendering, edit math, or UI behavior — observe the result yourself instead of asking the human how it looks, and record findings per the documented contract. Canonical guide (protocol, command table, statistics semantics, the observe→act→measure→verify improvement loop, findings schema): `docs/guides/agent-harness.md`.

## Invariants & boundaries

- TDD for behavior changes: tests first, testing the contract (app experience and mechanisms), not the code.
- File size: keep files under 500 LOC (hard ceiling 1000); split god-objects by lifecycle/role.
- Recursive loop status: photo does not run `playtest:recursive` yet — the agent harness is loop step 1.
- `src/repo.rs` is the single owner of repo-root discovery and of the harness sandbox override. Every repo-local store (`decoded-cache/`, `local-edits/`, `edited/`) resolves through it, stays a visible directory directly under the repo root, and is added to the list in `repo::tests::repo_local_dir_names`. A private copy of discovery anywhere else escapes the sandbox by construction.
- The Rust `viewer::Uniforms` struct and `assets/shaders/image.wgsl`'s `Uniforms` describe the same bytes twice with nothing relating them; a field added, reordered or retyped goes in on both sides in the same change, with the explicit padding that keeps std140 alignment. `uniforms_layout_matches_wgsl_uniform_buffer` asserts them against each other.
- Rotation and crop are decided once and read by four legs — preview fit, actual-size zoom, status text, and the exported file. A new consumer reads the same rotated, pixel-snapped rectangle, not the pre-rotation size.

## Conventions

- Devlog: `docs/devlog/summary.md` (one line per task; compact past 50 lines — no cheating with mega-lines) + `docs/devlog/detailed/START_DATE_END_DATE.md` (per-task entry: timestamp, action, reviewer findings by provider/theme, result, reasoning, notes; archive via `git mv` when the active file passes 500 lines, starting a new file dated today).
- Changelog `docs/changelog.md` + `Cargo.toml` version: user-visible changes only (external audience; migration focus). Bump `c` per non-breaking change, `b` (reset `c`) per breaking change, `a` only when the user says so; one bump per coherent shipped change.
- Architecture: structural changes update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and append a row to `docs/architecture/drift-log.md`; non-obvious tradeoffs append to `docs/architecture/decisions.md` (append-only — supersede, never delete). Non-structural fixes touch none of these.
- Lessons: `docs/learning/lessons.md` per the fleet evidence-anchor rule; code lessons need a real test id; photo-processing lessons record the affected sample image or batch and the before-after pixel diff or quality metric.
- Canonical doc surfaces are README, the architecture set, devlogs, changelog, and `docs/guides/agent-harness.md`. There is deliberately no `docs/api-reference.md` — the Rust types are the API reference. README changes when user-visible features change.
